Truthy/Falsey
  print('Enter a name.')
  name = input()
  if name:
    print('Thank you for entering a name.')
  else:
    print('You did not enter a name.')

This works because any non blank string is considered a 'Truthy'. 
So as long as the user inputs any value,the statement will evaluate to 'True'.
A blank string is considered to be falsey.
The proper way is to use
  if name != '':
For integers, 0 is falsey, all others are truthy.
For floats, 0.0 is falsey, all others are truthy.
Use bool() to check what a condition will evaluate to
